1. To use this application in proper way one should place *.pdf files inside the PDFMerger folder in a way that will make user sure about presence of pypdf2-Copy1.exe in the same directory.
2. If user is certain about correct placement of files that are going to be merged, user can run *.exe file.
3. The pop-up will appear and the names of files that are going to be merged will be shown (in alphabetical order, so it is a good option to have numbers before the names of *.pdf files, for example before the name of first file place 1, before second 2 and so on).
4. Then one can input name of new created *.pdf file. It will be created inside the PDFMerger folder.
